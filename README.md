# **Weather Project**

I have used **openweather** api in the project. In order for the project to work without error, you need to use your unique API key {appid}.

Please follow the instructions in the link, https://openweathermap.org/guide to get your unique API key.

Once you have your {appid}, please find the below line of code,

```javascript
  constructor() {
        this.clientID = // <appid> // ;
        this.location = '';
    }
```
in the file **weather.js**, and replace {appid} with your unquie API key.

*Happy Coding!!*
